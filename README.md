This is a simple command line chess application.
Please feel free to use, modify, or redistribute it however you wish. Although
some credit would be nice, it's not necessary.

Some of the more esoteric rules such as en-passent, or draw by 3x repetition 
are yet to be implemented and I cannot guarantee that I will implement them
in future.

Some cool features which would be nice to implement if you are so inclined are:
 - **[Sane]**
 - Game store and load functionality
 - Draw/resign functionality
 - Removing the old board from the screen before redrawing
 - Missing rules (some listed above)
 - History of moves played displayed on screen
 - A game timer
 - Nicer art :)
 - Ability to load in various art styles
 - **[Insane/complex]**
 - Playing against the computer
 - Networking functionality to play against other players

p.s. at time of writing this has only been tested on python 3.8.5 and likely
    contains several bugs.
